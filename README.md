# Northcoders House of Games API

Welcome to my NC-games repo!

This project designs a back end express server for a game review page where users can interact and comment on all kinds of reviews. 


using supertest and jest for our test suite! 
If you would like to run this project you'll need to create some enviornment variables!

After installing dotenv from npm, create a .env.{insert database name here} file for each database, then set your PGDATABASE variable to set database!
